# super-engine
**super-engine is now depreciated. I plan to make a similar project soon that works as a startpage and content scraper, but have not worked on this in long enought that people coming to this page should know that I don't look at it.**
This is just the title the GitHub name-choser chose for the repository. It is a way to turn JSON files into dynamic PHP pages.

## TODO
 - [ ] Add dark and nord theme.
 - [ ] Make title customizeable by page.
 - [ ] Make a decent icon.
 - [ ] Allow tabindex / autofocus to be selected as a parameter
 - [ ] Redirect to index.php
 - [ ] Add fonts
 - [ ] Create Installer / Makefile

## Notes

No, r/2b2t isn't FitMC's person subreddit, but I want to showcase all of the functionality in the sample JSON config, and it was the closest.
